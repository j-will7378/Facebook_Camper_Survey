"I suggest not restricting bootcamper's job tools to a specific geographic location. This put me in a difficult situation where the team I was pre-allocated for got re-orged away, but I couldn't search for new teams elsewhere in the company because I was geographically restricted.

It was kind of chaotic and it would have been nice if there was a more formal first introduction to the team meeting preferably with a manager.

Despite small number of reachouts, many teams have potential of getting headcount and are open to conversation for ML engineers, even if they are not shown in the Jobs tool. I found out about some teams only in weeks 5+,  through networking. Finding such teams should be easier in the jobs tool. One more thing is that rejections should include at least a small reason, or a dropdown menu (for managers also). Seeing a rejection email without any detail is just weird, but after reaching out to a manager afterwards, very simple and understandable explanations are usually received.",Most of the team selection process is not thorough the jobs tool so it doesn't help much beyond sending an initial message. I used my own separate notes to keep track of teams. 
"Jobs tool did not tell me about numerous jobs that were available and related to my specific interests, as a result, all of my searches turned up junk results and I am on a team that is not aligned with my interests","Bootcamp is awesome, plus the idea of sitting with the team to learn about their projects","The jobs tool is buggy and also can't reasonably filter out teams I've declined or who declined me. It's hard to stay focused using it because you have to sift through teams that clearly aren't a match (one or both parties has rejected the other, or the office is in the wrong location).

A manager let me sit with his team, and then when I said he wanted to join he told me he was looking at an internal transfer and waiting to hear back from another bootcamper .

All of the communication with hiring managers and with my mentor should be consolidated into an easy to reference, search and sort tool.","Good filtering.

"Mostly self-inflicted.  I rushed team selection, seeking to join a team before the too-new-to-evaluate cutoff, which meant I didn't properly evaluate the teams long enough.  Although less a reflection of the bootcamp team, I hope they will make it more clear rushing is not valuable in the future.",Everyone was extremely friendly and supporting throughout the entire process,,Good UI for reachouts,,"I guess the job tool can be a little more of an app, rather than a page. I remember my experience was relatively poor due to dozens of simultaneously open browser tabs without any relation between them.

That is cheating. I think that is unfair to teams who play by the rules and have multiple headcounts open.",
"Some teams with open positions matching my stream, when I expressed my interest after sitting with their team and working on a task, they rejected my candidacy. This happened with multiple teams.

I think the freedom in choosing the team is the greatest asset of current program.,
Team selection process added uncertainty to hiring process and since I already knew about the research one team is doing I decided to ask for pre-allocation before signing the contract. During bootcamp I realized that it would have been better if I followed the regular process. After sitting with the team for a week I discovered that our work styles differ a little. It took me the last few months to align that.,Found a good team.  Got extra time to find a team when first choice filled up.  Had plenty of time to acclimate to the company and team.,,I felt like the jobs tool was good in the initial reach-out process but there is not much need for it after talking to the hiring manager. ,,I received 50+ reachouts and I know many others do as well.

I'd suggest inserting a segment into NHO talking about how to evaluate a team and some heuristics for knowing if a team is a good fit for a bootcamper's skills and personality. I know of peers who go into team selection with no clue what to look out for and end up choosing a team based on trivial factors.,8
"The way team selection happens, it's so overwhelming that I found it very hectic and felt lot of pressure while going through it.",Found a team that satisfied the majority of my criteria,,I really only used the reachout tool... everything else (logistics etc) was done elsewhere ie workchat,,"I think that what the tool did was not made very clear during bootcamp. I was unsure what ""accept/reject"" for a team would do, and I didn't know if I should reach out to the manager or if they got a notification. I think having more transparency about what can be see in the whole process would be useful.",6
There was not place to find which teams are hiring. We had to ping managers around and find if they had headcount,"Found an awesome team to join, easy to find teams in tool",,"I think it worked fine, but it was misleading at first, it released the reach outs a little bit later than scheduled which caused a little bit of confusion",,"I think the experience may be very different based on office size.

"Time is too short! First, though we have 2 weeks, we want to speak to probably 5 managers or more bc I think many of us don't really know what the teams are doing. Second, after we talk to the manager, we will need to talk to PM/EM/DS/DE or let's say at least 2 other people in the team. That will triple the number(let's say you've narrow down to 3 teams already, then you'll meet 9 people). Third, Wed. usually cannot have meetings so we have 8 days in total. Fourth, we want to sit with the team for at least 1 day, this takes time and comes in order. Fifth, I think FB didn't tell the bootcampers how intense/little time they have to during team selection, so many of them are not prepared to speed up the process. Sixth, we sometime need to do task with the team so it requires more time. In general, I will say most bootcampers will consider: choosing the right team is their most important task during bootcamp so either we should get more time(Analytics track), or we need to be warned to be quick before the team selection.

,"I had the opportunity to try different teams and I was able to make a solid choice. As far as I can tell, this is unique to Facebook. It is also very good that the pressure is low during this process, meaning that it's not about closing tasks or making an impact, but really about finding the best team.

,I like the fact that I have about a week to see the team and the product and to get more signals before I make a decision,,"There are a lot of teams and positions listed and sometimes it can feel overwhelming, but it is definitely a good resource",,,
,I like the part where campers are allowed to actually sit with certain teams and work on actually projects that teams own,,There is a page that tracks all the reachouts. But the reachouts I sent to hiring mangers were not shown. I had to track them manually. Also the Jobs tool doesn't track which stage I am at with a particular team (engaged / chatted with HM/engineer/ sat with team / etc).,,,
,"I like the team I ended up on, but it was a slightly more difficult process than I had hoped",,There's no tool to track actual progress of team selection. Had to use Quip. Seems like this could be useful.,,,

,"I was given a chance to see and explore all the teams at Facebook. I'm also grateful that this process exists, since most companies just preallocate you.",,,,,
,I was given ample time and support while making the selection.  The reason I am not extremely satisfied is I do not feel like I understood well enough how facebook works at the time to take full advantage of the information to make the best choice.,,,,,

,"Ultimately, it seems up to the bootcamper to take initiative during the process. I think that this point should be emphasized more, especially in week 2 and 3. I think bootcampers should reach out ASAP if they're interested in a team so that they can ensure headcount doesn't get filled before they get to sit with them.",,,,,

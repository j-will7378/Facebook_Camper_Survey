# Facebook Boot Camp Survey

Meta's Bootcamp is a 6-8 week program for new employees to onboard and select a team. During this time, employees do not do any actual work. Instead, they receive in-depth training on Meta technologies and best practices. The boot camp includes a boot camp mentor to guide you through team selection. Participants are set up to matriculate through the program via in-depth training on Meta technologies and best practices.

We want to get a baseline measurement on what the camper experiences. This initial measurement will allow for future improvement of the program.

## Why is this important?
The boot camp for Facebook's new software engineer hires is one of the things that sets them apart from other tech companies. Giving SWE employees agency over what they will be working is a way to attract the best and the brightest. This ensures that new SWEs will work on things they care about.

### To alleviate the challenges of excess demand, how would you feel if the boot camp team selection process changed in one of the following ways?
- Limiting your reachouts (both sent and received from hiring teams, active and pending) to 5
- Limiting the types of teams that you can engage with (based on talent profile, level, skills)
- Introducing a matching system that determines which teams you can engage with based on your preferences (similar to the internship program or residency matching model)
- Preallocating all campers to designated pillars Keeping the current system where you and your teams are free to engage with any team that is a good fit

# Facebook Boot Camp Survey

Meta's Bootcamp is a 6-8 week program for new employees to onboard and select a team.During this time, employees do not do any actual work. Instead, they receive in-depth training on Meta technologies and best practices. The bootcamp includes a bootcamp mentor to guide you through team selection. Participants are set up to matriculate through the program via in-depth training on Meta technologies and best practices.

We want to get a baseline measurement on what the camper experience. This inital measurement will allow for futire improvement of the program.
